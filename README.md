# Example code

In class, we sometimes build code together to learn about new concepts. In this repository, I'll be posting clean versions of the code we write together, along with other code I think you might find useful.

This code will be very helpful as you prepare your problem sets.

Don't share the code in case some other professor out there assigns a problem set that looks like what we have here.
